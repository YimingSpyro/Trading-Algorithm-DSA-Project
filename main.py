This script is the main entry point for the Streamlit application that performs stock analysis 
and trading strategy evaluation. The application allows users to select stocks, analyze their 
performance, and review the results based on technical indicators and trading strategies. The 
results include stock ranking, trade bot performance, and visualizations of key indicators.

Features:
    - Allows the user to select stocks from a predefined list of tickers for analysis.
    - Analyzes selected stocks based on historical data using technical analysis functions.
    - Displays stock ranking and trading performance metrics, such as potential upside, 
      total return, and average return per trade.
    - Provides graphical visualizations of stock data, including key indicators such as 
      Bollinger Bands, MACD, and RSI, with buy and sell signals.
    - Optionally allows the user to download the analysis results as a PDF report (commented out in the code).

Modules:
    - streamlit: Used for creating the interactive web interface.
    - pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and organizing the analysis results.
    - technical_analysis: Contains the 'analyze_stock' function for performing the stock analysis.
    - data_visualizations: Provides 'plot_or_save_stock_data' for plotting stock data and 
      'download_results_as_pdf' for generating the PDF report.

Usage:
    Run the script to start the Streamlit application. The user can interact with the web interface 
    to select stocks, view analysis results, and visualize data. The application can be extended to 
    include additional functionalities, such as downloading a PDF report.
